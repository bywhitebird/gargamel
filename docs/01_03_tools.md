# Tools

## VSCode extension

To make it easier to work with Kaz files, you can use the VSCode extension that provides syntax highlighting, and TypeScript support. You can install it from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Whitebird.kaz-vscode).

In future, we plan to add more features to the extension, such as a better code completion.
