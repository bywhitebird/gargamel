# Getting Started

## Installation

Kazam is available as a CLI tool. To install it, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g kazam
```

You can also install it as a dev dependency and run it with `npx` or with a script in your `package.json`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev kazam
```

## Configuration

Kazam allows us to specify the input sources, determine the location for the output, and select parsers (such as `parser-kaz`) and transformers (such as `transformer-react`).

When we run a command, Kazam will look for a `kazam.config.ts` file or a `kazam.config.js` file in the current working directory.

You can also specify a custom configuration file with the `--config` option (or `-c` for short) followed by the path to the configuration file.

```bash
kazam generate --config ./my-config.js
```

You can define the configuration as an object in JavaScript or TypeScript.

```js
// kazam.config.js
import { ParserKaz } from '@whitebird/kazam-parser-kaz'
import { TransformerReact } from '@whitebird/kazam-transformer-react'

export default {
  input: ['./src'],
  output: './dist',
  parsers: [ParserKaz],
  transformers: [TransformerReact],
}
```

To define your configuration object with IntelliSense support, you can use the `defineConfig` function helper.

```ts
// kazam.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'kazam'
// ...

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
})
```

Alternatively, you can use the JSDoc annotation.

```ts
// kazam.config.ts
// ...

/** @type {import('kazam').UserConfig} */
export default {
  // ...
}
```

The configuration should be an object with the following properties:

- `input` - An array of strings understood by the parsers. It can be whatever the parsers support, such as a path to a file, to a directory, a glob pattern, or even a URL.
- `output` - A string that determines the location for the output. It can should be a path (relative or absolute) to a directory.
- `parsers` - An array of parsers.
- `transformers` - An array of transformers.

## Generating components with Kazam

Once you have configured Kazam, and you have valid input sources, you can generate components with the `generate` command.

```bash
kazam generate
```

When you run the `generate` command, Kazam will generate component files based on your input sources and the transformers you have specified in your configuration.

If you have specified only one transformer in your configuration, Kazam will generate the components in the output directory you specified in your configuration.

If you have specified multiple transformers, Kazam will create a separate directory for each transformer in the output directory. The directory name will be derived from the name of the transformer class by removing the "Transformer" preffix and converting the remaining part to lowercase. For example, if you have specified `TransformerReact` and `TransformerVue` in your configuration, Kazam will generate the components in the `output/react` and `output/vue` directories respectively.
