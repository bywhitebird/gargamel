# Introduction

## Overview of Kazam

Kazam is a versatile library that empowers developers to effortlessly generate components in a wide range of formats and tools, including React, Vue, Svelte, and Figma, all from a single codebase and unified tool, such as Kaz or Figma.

## Benefits of using Kazam

Kazam allows you to separate your components from your application code, making it easier to maintain and reuse them across different projects.

## Use case examples

### Easily change your application's UI framework without rewriting your components

The Javascript ecosystem is constantly moving very fast, and it's not uncommon to see a new UI framework or tool emerge every few months. Kazam allows you to future-proof your application by making it easy to switch to a new UI framework or tool without having to rewrite your components.

### Create a component library compatible with different frameworks and tools

Many companies have to use different UI frameworks and tools across their projects while conserving a consistent look and feel. Kazam allows you to create a component library that can be used across all the company's projects, regardless of the framework or tool used.

## Comparison with other tools

### Stencil

Stencil is one of the most popular tools for generating components usable across different frameworks. However, Stencil makes use of web components, while Kazam generates components in the native format of the target framework or tool.

Moreover, Kazam is really focused on the developer experience, providing a smooth and easy-to-use toolchain, with first-class support for TypeScript, while keeping it powerful and flexible.
