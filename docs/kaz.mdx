# Kaz

## Introduction to Kaz

Kaz is a language specifically crafted for UI component development. Drawing inspiration from TypeScript, Pug, and Edge, Kaz's syntax is designed to be both familiar and intuitive. The Kaz language's readability and intuitive design further aid in its ease of use, allowing developers (even those who are new to Kaz) to create UI components with efficiency and ease.

## Kaz syntax and structure

Kaz is composed of two distinct parts: instructions and templates. Instructions define the properties, states, computed properties, and watchers of the component, while templates define its structure and appearance. To keep things organized, instructions are placed at the top of the file, while templates are placed after them.

## Instructions

Instructions are used to define the properties, states, computed properties, and watchers of the component. They start with a dash (`-`) and are placed at the top of the file, before the template.

### Imports

As in JavaScript, the `import` instruction is used to import modules. All valid JavaScript import syntaxes are supported: default imports, named imports, imports with alias, namespace imports, and side effect imports.

```kaz
- import _ from 'lodash'
- import { ofetch } from 'ofetch'
- import * as utils from './utils'
- import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css'
```

### Properties

The `prop` instruction is used to define a property. Properties are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They can have types and default values.

```kaz
- prop name: string
- prop age = 18
```

### States

The `state` instruction is used to define a state. States are used to store data that can be changed by the component. They can have types and default values.

```kaz
- state name: string
- state age = 18
```

### Computed

The `computed` instruction is used to compute a value from the component's data. They need to have an expression that returns the computed value. They can have types.

```kaz
- computed fullName: string = \`${name} ${lastName}\`
```

### Watchers

The `watch` instruction is used to watch for changes in a component's data. They need to have a function that will be called when the data changes. The data listened needs to be specified in the parameters of the function.

```kaz
- watch (name, age) => {
    console.log(name, age)
  }
```

## Templating

Templating is used to define the structure and appearance of the component. They are placed after the instructions.

### Tags

Tags are used to define HTML elements. They need to have a name followed by a pair of parentheses. They can have a pair of curly braces if they have children.

As in HTML, text does not need to be wrapped by special characters. It can be written directly inside the tag.

You can also use a dollar sign (`$`) with a pair of curly braces to insert a variable or an expression.

```kaz
div() {
  h1() {
    Hello, ${name}!
  }
  br()
}
```

### Attributes and events

Tags can have attributes and events. Attributes are defined by a name and a value. If the value is a string, it can be wrapped in single or double quotes. If the value is a variable or an expression, it can be wrapped in curly braces. Events are defined by the `on:` prefix followed by the name of the event and a value that is a function.

```kaz
img(src={imageSrc}, alt="Image")
button(on:click={() => console.log('Clicked!')}) {
  Click me!
}
```

### Loops

You can use the `@for` directive to iterate over something. Any `for` parameters valid in JavaScript are supported.

```kaz
ul() {
  @for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    li() {
      ${i}
    }
  }
  @for (const item of items) {
    li() {
      ${item}
    }
  }
  @for (const key in object) {
    li() {
      ${key}: ${object[key]}
    }
  }
}
```

### Conditionals

You can use the `@if` directive to conditionally render something. Any `if` parameters valid in JavaScript are supported.

```kaz
@if (name === 'John') {
  h1() {
    Hello, John!
  }
}
@if (age >= 18) {
  h1() {
    You are an adult!
  }
}
```
